# React Movie App

A movie app that queries Movie API from OMBD API created with React.js.



## How To Run

To run this project, first execute

```bash
  npm install
```

After npm install successfully completed, execute the following command

```bash
  npm start
```


## Notes

- OMDB API doesn't allow to filter only by year. Year needs to be dependent of ID or Title of the movies. For this reason, filter for year can only be used when a valid title is given.
- The name EXFILM for this project comes from Exxen and Netflix movie/series platforms. It doesn't have any rights or licence.
